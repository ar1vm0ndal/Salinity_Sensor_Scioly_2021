# Salinity_Sensor_Scioly_2021

Used for the Detector Building Event for the 2021 Scioly Season and Texas State Scioly
Using the Device, my partner and I won 4th Place at the State Tournament.

The hardest part was debugging the sensor we constructed ourselves. When dipping into an unknown liquid, a frequent problem would occur where the Sensor's tip would ionize dissolved solids and form visible residue. Ultimately, we solved this before State, as we limited the rate at which samples were taken by the sensor.
